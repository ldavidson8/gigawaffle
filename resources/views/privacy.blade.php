                <p>
                    Information you choose to give us might include personal data needed for filling in forms on our websites or apps or by 
                    corresponding with us by phone, email, live chat or in discussion forums. This includes information you provide when you do 
                    a price comparison, enter into a contract for the supply of services, enter a competition, promotion or survey, give us 
                    feedback, leave a comment or enter into a discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The personal information that you provide may include basic stuff needed to make an application such as names and 
                    contact details but may include financial information and other information about you to enable us to provide you 
                    with our price comparison, switching and other services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some products, you may need to provide us with certain special category data to allow us to provide you with quotes. 
                    This includes information about health (for an energy provider to assess whether you have any special requirements).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you provide this information to us, we will ask for your consent to use your special category data in accordance

                    engine providers and analytic service providers) and may receive information about you from them. For example, 
                    if you've redirected to an energy supplier's website or app to complete your application, we might collect 
                    information from them about whether you went ahead with your application and what you applied for. We may combine 
                    this information with other information you have provided to us or which we collected about you.

                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Consent</p>
                <p>
                    You have consented to us using your personal data for this purpose (for example, when you agree to receive marketing emails

                <p class="font-weight-bold">Legitimate interests</p>
                <p>
                    It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal data to operate and improve our services (for example, when we customise 
                    your experience of our services or use your information for analytic purposes), for security and fraud prevention, for 
                    identifying and correcting faults with our services and to protect our business.

                    We keep your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, or as required to for 
                    legal reasons. These periods vary depending on why it was collected, or if we have a continuing legal basis to do 
                    so (such as to fulfil a contract between us, perform a service you requested or for our legitimate interests). 
                    We'll then either delete it or anonymise it so it doesn't identify you.
